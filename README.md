# Boaty tools

Boaty tools is a GUI application that tries to enhance your Midjourney experiences by using web scraping to run prompts via Discord.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to simplify and enrich the process of prompting Midjourney. Using discord to interact with Midjourney can be cumbersome and lack the excitement that comes with interactive prompts.

## Features

- **Group Prompts in Projects**: Organize your prompts by creating projects, making it easy to manage prompts based on specific journeys or themes.
